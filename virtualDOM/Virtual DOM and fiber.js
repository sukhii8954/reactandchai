// createRoot method in main.jsx

/* it creates a dom like structure behind the scenes 
and it compare main dom and its own dom and update those
things which are updated on UI */

/* :- reconciliation :- it is a react algo which reconsider 
what to update or check , in general React algo uses 
to differentiate one tree(browser tree and react tree comes from createRoot ) with another to determine which 
parts need to be changed. */


/* update :-
A change in the data to render a React app. Usually the result  of 
`setState` Eventually results in a re-render. */

// keys are used in react as if we want to improve the performance 
// of list in fibre algo in react so for each iteration at list or UI we 
// have to use keys . keys should be "stable ,predictable and unique"
